## Table of contents

### Inspiration

We realized that Season of Commits, conducted by the FOSS United community in collaboration with other organizations doesn't have an unified platform for management and orchestration of the event, leading to unstructured information access and less outreach.

### Goals

Our primary objectives are to:

- Build an intuitive platform that integrates in a seamless manner with FOSS United's website as the entire application leverages Frappe Framework and Frappe UI for orchestration of Season of Commits for adherence with its design system, which helps in easier event management

- Aid in improvement of outreach and adoption of FOSS and promoting the true spirit of FOSS contribution

- Aid in easier orchestration and adoption of Season of Commits for other open-source organizations by providing a structured event management scheme

### Features

#### Centralized registration and management

Facilitation of organization, mentor and contributor registration through a centralized interface

#### Proposal submission

Submit proposal for inclusion of a mentor organization willing to participate in the event along with creation of contributor and mentor proposal to an existing open-source project listed by partner organizations.

#### Approval management

Accept and approve mentors, contributors and partner organizations based on their proposal details for better scrutinzation

## Tech Stack
